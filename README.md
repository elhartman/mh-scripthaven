Most popular script is the New Configuration, which disables annoying preset Windows features. This script requires you to run Install Dependencies first on most machines (Windows 10 and later only), and will also attempt to install MS Office. **You will need to add your own config file** to data/office for this to work, and a config can be generated at https://config.office.com/
